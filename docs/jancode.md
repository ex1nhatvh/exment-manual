### Enabling JAN Barcode Settings  
- To make the JAN barcode functionality available for the target table, you need to "Enable" it. After saving, click the "Enable" button in the top-right corner of the page.  
- Only one of either the 2D barcode or the JAN barcode can be enabled at a time.  
  If the 2D barcode is enabled, the "Enable" button for JAN barcode functionality will not appear, and it cannot be enabled. Similarly, if the JAN barcode is enabled, the 2D barcode cannot be enabled.
