### Solution
Please take one of the following actions:

- (Recommended) If you can upload the entire project (including Exments): Solution 1
- If for some reason you can't upload the entire project (e.g. you want to keep the Exment version), try the solution 2.

※ Considering the impact of this issue, we are also updating Exment v5, the PHP 8 version.

#### Solution 1: If you can upload the entire project (including Exment)

Please update Exment and laravel-admin by clicking [here](/update).  
※exceedone/exment will be updated to v6.1.5 or higher, and exceedone/laravel-admin will be updated to v4.1.2 or higher.   
※If for some reason you are still using PHP8, exceedone/exment will be updated to v5.0.12 or higher, and exceedone/laravel-admin will be updated to 3.0.3 or higher.

#### Solution 2: If you are unable to update for some reason

'filename_not_allow' => 'A prohibited character is used in :attribute. Please change the file name and try again.',

```

```php

use Illuminate\Contracts\Validation\Rule;
/**

class FileNameRule implements Rule

     */
    public function passes($attribute, $value)
    {
        if ($value instanceof \Illuminate\Http\UploadedFile) {
            $filename = $value->getClientOriginalName();
        } else {
            $filename = pathinfo($value, PATHINFO_BASENAME);
        }
        return !preg_match('/[\/\\\:\*\?\"<>\|]/', $filename);
    }
