## important point

- Depending on your environment and version, you may not be able to set up properly with this procedure. Please note.

- In this procedure, only the procedure for operating Exment on Linux is described.  
AWS does not describe general IT-related knowledge such as SSH, database creation, and Linux commands. Please note.  

- **In this procedure, it is assumed that you are running with an administrator account. If executed by a user other than the administrator account, add "sudo" to the beginning.**

- This procedure is based on this [AWS tutorial](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ja_jp/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-lamp-amazon-linux-2.html#setting-file-permissions-2).

## Correspondence at the time of PHP version upgrade
If you want to change the PHP version, please follow the steps below to upgrade.  
*You will not be able to access Exment during the version upgrade process.  
*The example below is the procedure for updating from PHP7.2 to PHP7.4.  
*It is assumed that PHP is installed using the Extras Library (amazon-linux-extras) of Amazon Linux 2.  
*The version upgrade method may differ depending on the environment, installation time, version and installation method.  

- Make sure you have the amazon-linux-extras package installed.  

~~~
which amazon-linux-extras
# If it is not installed, install it with the following command.
# sudo yum install -y amazon-linux-extras
~~~

- Check the PHP version and the Extras Library topic.  
*PHP version is 7.2.X. Make sure the PHP 7.2 topic is enabled and the PHP 7.4 topic exists.  

~~~
php -v
amazon-linux-extras | grep php
~~~

- Disable the PHP 7.2 topic.  

~~~
sudo amazon-linux-extras disable php7.2
~~~

- Install the PHP 8.2 topic.  

~~~
sudo amazon-linux-extras install php8.2
~~~

- Make sure the PHP version is 8.2.X, the PHP 7.2 topic is disabled, and the PHP 8.2 topic is enabled.  

~~~
php -v
amazon-linux-extras | grep php
~~~
